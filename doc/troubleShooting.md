## Troubleshooting

Be sure to put an ending PHP tag in your PHP files as the OTRA PHP rewriting system needs them to work correctly.

If you use `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` in your website, don't forget to specify in your terminal, via your IDE or not, this
 environment variable in order to make the console tasks work correctly.
