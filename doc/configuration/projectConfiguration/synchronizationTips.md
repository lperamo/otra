#### Tips for faster synchronization

If your editor does not synchronize fast enough with external modifications (in the case of file watchers for example),
you can check this :

```bash
cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```

If this shows a lower number than 524288 then edit the file `/etc/sysctl.conf` and adds this line :

```bash
fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 524288
```

Once you have done that, you must apply this change by doing :

```bash
sudo sysctl -p --system
```

Don't forget to restart your IDE after that operation.

In the case of PHPStorm, you also can go to :
 
_Settings > Appearange & Behavior > System settings > Synchronization_
 
Here you can put `Save files automatically if application is idle for` to *1* second.

This way, you will see much faster your JavaScript files generated by TypeScript for example.
