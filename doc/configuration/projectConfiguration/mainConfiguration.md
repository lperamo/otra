#### Main configuration

You could use the file `tests/config/AllConfig.php` to know how you can configure it.<br>
Do not touch `bundles/config/Config.php`, it is a generated file.<br>
This file can be moved in a later version of the framework.<br>
The file you have to configure is `bundles/App/config/` where `App` is the name of ... your application.
