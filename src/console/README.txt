Console colors
==============

to correctly convert the ANSI colors code in DOS mode under Windows, you have to retrieve the executable via this url :

http://adoxa.altervista.org/ansicon/

And execute it before launching the console.

(Or maybe you can use ConEmu: https://conemu.github.io/).

Fixtures generation
===================

Common errors :

- Try to use the clean task in simple mode then in full mode if there are no changes.
- For the keys, if we want to refer to another table id then we have to use the name of the table and not to the name of the property!
